## Project Roadmap - Rural Hospital Closure Risk ##
1. DONE. Create github team for project - Victor
2. DONE. Create github repository - Victor
3. DONE. Define project goals and parameters in README file - Victor
4. DONE. Download data from https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/programs-projects/rural-health/rural-hospital-closures/ -Francis
5. DONE. Convert data to .csv - Francis
6. DONE. Watch pandas tutorial from https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pandas-tutorial-dataframe-python. Install and run pandas for dataset - Francis
7. DONE. Write and test code to import dataset
8. DONE. Make any modifications to dataset to remove missing data
9. DONE. Using folium, plot the hospital closures on a map for each state (starting with state with largest number of closures)
10. DONE Create project webpage template via Python Flask 
11. Code Flask page to enable user to input state and visualize hospital closures on a map
12. Using the flask map, link closure data to the plotted points
12. Use code to analyze dataset to help determine which variables factor into a hospital's closure.
13. Separate variables on supposed impact to hospital closure to find a pattern in the rural hospitals' closures.
14. Write documentation for final project and create short presentation about the project
